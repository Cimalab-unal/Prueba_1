### Summary of Best Practices: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745
1. Write programs for people, not computers.
    - A program should not require its readers to hold more than a handful of facts in memory at once.
    - Make names consistent, distinctive, and meaningful.
    - Make code style and formatting consistent.
2. Let the computer do the work.
    - Make the computer repeat tasks.
    - Save recent commands in a file for re-use.
Use a build tool to automate workflows.
3. Make incremental changes.
    - Work in small steps with frequent feedback and course correction.
    - Use a version control system.
    - Put everything that has been created manually in version control.
4. Don't repeat yourself (or others).
    - Every piece of data must have a single authoritative representation in the system.
    - Modularize code rather than copying and pasting.
    - Re-use code instead of rewriting it.
5. Plan for mistakes.
    - Add assertions to programs to check their operation.
    - Use an off-the-shelf unit testing library.
    - Turn bugs into test cases.
    - Use a symbolic debugger.
6. Optimize software only after it works correctly.
    - Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks.
    - Write code in the highest-level language possible.
7. Document design and purpose, not mechanics.
    - Document interfaces and reasons, not implementations.
    - Refactor code in preference to explaining how it works.
    - Embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software.
8. Collaborate.
    - Use pre-merge code reviews.
    - Use pair programming when bringing someone new up to speed and when tackling particularly tricky problems.
    - Use an issue tracking tool.
