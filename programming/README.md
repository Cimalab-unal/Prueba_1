### Summary of Best Practices:

1. Use a version control system, you must create your own repository on GitHub and commit your changes constantly.
2. Make code style and formatting consistent.
3. Modularize code rather than copying and pasting, re-use code instead of rewriting it. 
4. Make variable names consistent, distinctive, meaningful, and short as far as you can.
5. Use a debugger to find bugs in your code.
6. Optimize software only after it works correctly.
7. Embed the brief documentation at the beginning of each module, function, or script.
